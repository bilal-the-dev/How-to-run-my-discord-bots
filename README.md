# What is this?

I have added a lot of repo's for discord bots i made. Here's a general guide how you could run em.


## Environment Variables

You'll see a `sample.env` file in all my repositries. Create a file called `.env` and paste the content of sample file into it.
Replace the dummy values with original ones.
#

## Configuration

Sometimes the project may have a `sample.config.json` for ids of channels and other things. Just create a `config.json` file and paste the content of former file into latter.


## Installation

- Install **Git** from [here](https://git-scm.com/download)
- After installing, right click on desktop and open `git bash`
- Clone the repositry using the cmd `git clone [url of repo here]`

## Run Locally
- Download **nodejs** from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Download **vs code** from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Open the folder, git created, in vs code then open terminal and run the following cmds successively.
```bash
  npm install
  node index
```
Boom! The bot is on :D
